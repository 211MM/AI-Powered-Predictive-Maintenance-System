# AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance System

## 📖 Overview
This project is a capstone implementation of an **AI-driven predictive maintenance solution** for industrial equipment.  
For this project, we used **turbofan engines** from the **NASA CMAPSS dataset** as the basis for training and evaluation.  

The system combines:
- **Machine learning classification** using Random Forests  
- **Time-series forecasting** with LSTM neural networks  

Together, these models predict equipment failures and estimate the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of critical components.
