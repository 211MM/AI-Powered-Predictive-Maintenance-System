# AI-Powered-Predictive-Maintenance-System
This Project is a capstone implementation of an AI-driven predictive maintenance solution for industrial equipment, for this project we used turbo fan engines from a NASA CMPASS dataset. This project combines machine learning classifications such as Random Forests with time-series forecasting like LSTM neural networks to predict equipment failures.
